# The Ceal Chronicler f

A Flutter Project for a Windows/Android app for keeping track of characters, locations and events in a book or role playing game. It is presently optimized for windows, but will work on Android too.

The main idea is that you can create a chronicle of your book or campaign, keeping track of who was where at what point in time, what they knew, what skills and items they had, etc...

## Features

* Creating a timeline with incidents, characters, locations and parties
* Switching between multiple points in time
* Characters, locations and parties have fields that can change over time
* Characters, locations and parties have a few fixed fields, along with flexible attribute fields that can be filled with whatever you need
* Locations can be connected to other location, and feature an editable hierarchy too
* Characters can be assigned to parties, and the party's location will override the character's location while the character is part of a party, thus enabling characters to be moved as a group
